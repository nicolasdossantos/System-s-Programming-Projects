This are the values I used for my last run. I've played around with the min an max times, and I've notices that they
greatly influence the results. High values make the simulation too short. Equal values for ARRRIVE and CPU results on
too many arrivals. For the service times I have tried to stay as realistically as possible.

SEED        10
QUIT_PROB   20
INIT_TIME   0
FIN_TIME    10000
ARRIVE_MIN  10
ARRIVE_MAX  30
CPU_MIN     10
CPU_MAX     30
DISK_I_MIN  10
DISK_I_MAX  30
DISK_II_MIN 10
DISK_II_MAX 30
